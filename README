Sequest is proprietary software and can not be freely distributed, but
this project can hopefully help build private packages for local
use. This package also includes a wrapper around sequest used by TINT
(https://github.com/jmchilton/tint) .

Prerequistes:

Install fpm: https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm

% sudo apt-get install ruby
% sudo gem install fpm

How to use:

Simply run build.sh. The debian package will be created in this
directory.
